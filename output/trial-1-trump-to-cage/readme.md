objective = swap trump by cage
epoches = 20000
time = 2h+ on gpu
training volume = {trump: {found: 376, detected: 318} , cage: {found: 318, detected: 342} }
subjective comment = poor to mediocre quality

limitation:

- lateral or angular or from-bottom shots are not converted

- hatted and mouth-covering shots are poorly converted, if not ignored too

- explicit rectangle is transplanted on face

- Non-commutative: training -B must be swap destination
